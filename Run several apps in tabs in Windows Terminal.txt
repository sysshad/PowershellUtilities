# Author: Stig Br√§nnlund 2025

# Example 1

function Start-DotNetApps {
    # Array of applications with their paths
    $appPaths = @(
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe",  # Application 1
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe",  # Application 2
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"   # Application 3
    )

    # Delay between opening tabs
    $delay = 5

    # Loop through each application in the array
    foreach ($appPath in $appPaths) {
        # Open a new tab with PowerShell, and run the app inside the tab
        wt -w 0 new-tab -- powershell -Command "& '$appPath'"
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $delay
    }
}


# Example 2 with working directory


function Start-DotNetApps {
    # Array of applications with their paths
    $appPaths = @(
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe",  # Application 1
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe",  # Application 2
        "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"   # Application 3
    )

    # Delay between opening tabs
    $delay = 5

    # Working directory for the applications
    $workingDir = "D:\"

    # Loop through each application in the array
    foreach ($appPath in $appPaths) {
        # Open a new tab with PowerShell, and run cmd.exe inside the tab with the specified working directory
        wt -w 0 new-tab -- powershell -Command "Start-Process -FilePath '$appPath' -WorkingDirectory '$workingDir' -NoNewWindow"
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $delay
    }
}
